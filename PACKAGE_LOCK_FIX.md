# Package Lock File Mismatch Fix

## 🚨 Error Encountered:
```
npm error `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.
npm error Invalid: lock file's p-queue@7.4.1 does not satisfy p-queue@6.6.2
```

## 🔍 Root Cause:
The `package-lock.json` file contained the old p-queue version 7.4.1 and its dependencies, but we updated `package.json` to use p-queue 6.6.2. This created a version mismatch that prevented Heroku from installing dependencies.

## ✅ Fix Applied:
1. **Deleted old package-lock.json** - Removed the outdated lock file
2. **Regenerated dependencies** - Ran `npm install` to create new lock file
3. **Version sync** - New package-lock.json now matches package.json

## 🚀 Deploy the Fixed Version:

### Option 1: Use Fixed Package (Recommended)
```bash
# Extract the corrected package
tar -xzf stock-screener-fixed-lockfile-package.tar.gz
cd stock-screener

# Deploy to Heroku
git add .
git commit -m "Fix package-lock.json version mismatch"
git push heroku main
```

### Option 2: Manual Fix (If needed)
```bash
# In your existing project:
rm package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Then deploy
git add .
git commit -m "Regenerate package-lock.json"
git push heroku main
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes:
- ✅ Resolves npm dependency version conflicts
- ✅ Ensures package.json and package-lock.json are synchronized
- ✅ Allows Heroku build process to complete successfully
- ✅ Maintains all functionality with correct p-queue version

## 📚 Technical Details:

**Why this happened:**
- We changed p-queue version in package.json from 7.4.1 to 6.6.2
- The old package-lock.json still referenced version 7.4.1
- Heroku's `npm ci` requires exact version matching between files

**Why the fix works:**
- `npm install` generates a new package-lock.json
- New lock file matches the updated package.json versions
- All dependency versions are now consistent

## 🔍 Verification:
After deployment, check:
```bash
heroku logs --tail    # Should show successful build
heroku ps             # Should show running dynos
heroku open           # Should load your app
```

Your app should now build and deploy successfully on Heroku! 🚀
